1st Date She & 1st Date He

1st Date – She

I said I liked classical music.
It wasn’t exactly a lie.
I hoped he would get the impression
That my brow was acceptably high.

I said I liked classical music. 
I mentioned Vivaldi and Bach. 
And he asked me along to this concert. 
Here we are, sitting in the half-dark. 

I was thrilled to be asked to the concert. 
I couldn't decide what to wear.
I hope I look tastefully sexy.
I've done what I can with my hair.

Yes, I'm thrilled to be here at this concert.
I couldn’t care less what they play
But I’m trying my hardest to listen
So I'll have something clever to say. 

When I glance at his face it’s a picture
Of rapt concentration. I see 
He is totally into this music
And quite undistracted by me.
 

1st Date – He

She said she liked classical music. 
I implied I was keen on it too. 
Though I don’t often go to a concert,
It wasn’t entirely untrue.

I looked for a suitable concert
And here we are, on our first date. 
The traffic was dreadful this evening
And I arrived ten minutes late. 
 
So we haven’t had much time for talking
And I’m a bit nervous. I see
She is totally lost in the music
And quite undistracted by me. 

In that dress she is very attractive – 
The neckline can’t fail to intrigue. 
I mustn’t appear too besotted. 
Perhaps she is out of my league. 

Where are we? I glance at the programme
But I’ve put my glasses away.
I’d better start paying attention
Or else I’ll have nothing to say.
