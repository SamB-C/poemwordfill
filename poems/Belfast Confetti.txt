Belfast Confetti

Suddenly as the riot squad moved in, it was raining
    exclamation marks,
Nuts, bolts, nails, car-keys. A fount of broken type. And the
    explosion.
Itself - an asterisk on the map. This hyphenated line, a burst
    of rapid fire...
I was trying to complete a sentence in my head but it kept
    stuttering,
All the alleyways and side streets blocked with stops and
    colons.

I know this labyrinth so well - Balaclava, Raglan, Inkerman,
    Odessa Street -
Why can't I escape? Every move is punctuated. Crimea
    Street. Dead end again.
A Saracen, Kremlin-2 mesh. Makrolon face-shields. Walkie-
    talkies. What is
My name? Where am I coming from? Where am I going? A
    fusillade of question-marks.
