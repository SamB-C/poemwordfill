Cousin Kate

I was a cottage-maiden
    Hardened by sun and air,
Contented with my cottage-mates,
    Not mindful I was fair.
Why did a great lord find me out
    And praise my flaxen hair?
Why did a great lord find me out
    To fill my heart with care?

He lured me to his palace-home –
    Woe's me for joy thereof –
To lead a shameless shameful life,
    His plaything and his love.
He wore me like a golden knot,
    He changed me like a glove:
So now I moan an unclean thing
    Who might have been a dove.

O Lady Kate, my Cousin Kate,
    You grow more fair than I:
He saw you at your father's gate,
    Chose you and cast me by.
He watched your steps along the lane,
    Your sport among the rye:
He lifted you from mean estate
    To sit with him on high.

Because you were so good and pure
    He bound you with his ring:
The neighbours call you good and pure,
    Call me an outcast thing.
Even so I sit and howl in dust
    You sit in gold and sing:
Now which of us has tenderer heart?
    You had the stronger wing.

O Cousin Kate, my love was true,
    Your love was writ in sand:
If he had fooled not me but you,
    If you stood where I stand,
He had not won me with his love
    Nor bought me with his land:
I would have spit into his face
    And not have taken his hand.

Yet I've a gift you have not got
    And seem not like to get:
For all your clothes and wedding-ring
    I've little doubt you fret.
My fair-haired son, my shame, my pride,
    Cling closer, closer yet:
Your sire would give broad lands for one
    To wear his coronet.

Christina Rossetti
