Where the Picnic Was

Where we made the fire, 
In the summer time, 
Of branch and briar 
On the hill to the sea 
I slowly climb 
Through winter mire, 
And scan and trace 
The forsaken place 
Quite readily. 

Now a cold wind blows, 
And the grass is gray, 
But the spot still shows 
As a burnt circle–aye, 
And stick-ends, charred, 
Still strew the sward 
Whereon I stand, 
Last relic of the band 
Who came that day! 

Yes, I am here 
Just as last year, 
And the sea breathes brine 
From its strange straight line 
Up hither, the same 
As when we four came. 
– But two have wandered far 
From this grassy rise 
Into urban roar 
Where no picnics are, 
And one–has shut her eyes 
For evermore. 

Thomas Hardy
