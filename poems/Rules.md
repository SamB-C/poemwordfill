# Rules for poem files

## No spaces on empty lines

Word replacement to inputs will not work if a blank line has spaces in.

## Title placement

1. The title of the poem should be on the very first line of the file.
2. There must be an empty line between the poem title and the beggining of the poem.

```txt
Ozymandias                                      <-- Title

I met a traveller from an antique land....      <-- Content
```

## Author placement

1. The author of the poem must be placed on the last line of the poem
2. There must be a blank line between the last line of the poem content and the author

```txt
... lone and level sands stretch far away.      <-- Content

Percy Bysshe Shelley                            <-- Author
```

_Note: The author will be auto capitalised by the program when rendered_

## Speech Marks

Speech Marks `"` are illegal characters that will mess up the HTML. They should not be used, and instead the opening and closing speech marks `“` and `”` should be used.

_Note: The user will be able to use regular quotes `"` in place of the opening and closing quotes, when filling in words._
