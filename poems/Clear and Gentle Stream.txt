Clear and Gentle Stream

Clear and gentle stream! 
Known and loved so long, 
That hast heard the song 
And the idle dream 
Of my boyish day; 
While I once again 
Down thy margin stray, 
In the selfsame strain 
Still my voice is spent, 
With my old lament 
And my idle dream, 
Clear and gentle stream! 

Where my old seat was 
Here again I sit, 
Where the long boughs knit 
Over stream and grass 
A translucent eaves: 
Where back eddies play 
Shipwreck with the leaves, 
And the proud swans stray, 
Sailing one by one 
Out of stream and sun, 
And the fish lie cool 
In their chosen pool. 

Many an afternoon 
Of the summer day 
Dreaming here I lay; 
And I know how soon, 
Idly at its hour, 
First the deep bell hums 
From the minster tower, 
And then evening comes, 
Creeping up the glade, 
With her lengthening shade, 
And the tardy boon 
Of her brightening moon. 

Clear and gentle stream! 
Ere again I go 
Where thou dost not flow, 
Well does it beseem 
Thee to hear again 
Once my youthful song, 
That familiar strain 
Silent now so long: 
Be as I content 
With my old lament 
And my idle dream, 
Clear and gentle stream.
