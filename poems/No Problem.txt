No Problem

I am not de problem
But I bear de brunt
Of the silly playground taunts
An racist stunts,
I am not de problem
I am born academic
But dey got me on de run
Now im a branded athletic
I am not de problem
If yu give I a chance
I can teach yu of Timbuktu
I can do more dan dance
I am not de problem
I greet yu wid a smile
Yu put me in a pigeon hole
But i am versatile

These conditions may affect me
As I get older,
An I am positively sure
I have no chips on my shoulders,
Black is not de problem
Mother country get it right
An juss fe de record,
Sum of me best friends are white.
